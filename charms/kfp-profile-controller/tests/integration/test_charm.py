# TODO: Real testing requires:
#  * kubeflow-profile controller, or something that will make namespaces/service accounts in a
#    similar fashion (some resources deployed to each namespace by kfp-profile-controller use the
#    `default-editor` service account, which is created by the main kubeflow-profile controller)
#  * This charm deploying successfully is not a full test of function.  We need to create a new
#    tracked namespace (namespace that has label pipelines.kubeflow.org/enabled=true) and ensure
#    all expected resources are deployed and come up successfully (eg: if service account is not
#    found, deployments will exist but pods will never be "ready")
